## Description
In the folder **_Code_** you will be able to find the implementation  of both, baseline and proposed, methods from the paper. All results files and images of the paper can be found in the folder **_Results_**.

The proposed method is capable of explicit modelling evolving boundaries, by coupling the _floating node method_ and the _level set method_, in an accurate and efficient way. You can find more details on the theory, implementation and results in the [manuscript](http:\\).
